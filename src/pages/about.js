      So, I went through design school right after high school. It was a Diploma in Digital Design, all the design principles applied straight in digital tools. You can say it was around 80% of the time were digital and 20% something we had to build or work with our hands. This was fundamental to build effective communication with UX teams.

      Before I start my third semester at the Design School, there weren't enough students to open the classes. I had two options, move to Caracas -I'm from Venezuela- or wait for a semester. I waited and decided to take cooking classes and work as a cook in several restaurants back home. It was an incredible experience. Cooking gives you a different perspective on how things are done and the importance of each process.

      After a year, I go back to Design School to finish my diploma. After school, I decided to spend a few months in the United States as I was 21 years old, and it was the first time I traveled alone. I managed to get a job as a carpenter building furniture at a small workshop through a friend. Once more, I learned the importance of each process, how dangerous can be a table saw and how hot Miami is during summer.

      After a few months, I went back home and went through several jobs, from news video editor on a TV station, web development, and VJ/DJ. In 2012 I moved to Chile. The first year and a half worked again on a TV station which was a fantastic opportunity to understand a new country through the news.

      Then there it was my debut at a startup, a small company with a parking lot marketplace that needed a frontend developer. Then the device tracking app and the end-to-end email encryption company led me to TechStars in San Antonio, TX., a Real State marketplace, and a biotech company. On the last one, I could develop myself as a leader, build teams and products. Nowadays, I work on one of the best Latin American companies, bringing finance to 70% of the population with no access to formal banking.

      My passion for music has always been present. I have a diploma in music production, a home studio and, a lot of music that  I'm starting to release.

      As I mentioned in the title of this entry, a quote from Steven Kotler, you can't have too many arrows on your quiver, which is why I started this site. I want to give myself a try writing -as I'm reading a lot these days- and, probably, showcasing some 3D work that I'm doing for fun!
