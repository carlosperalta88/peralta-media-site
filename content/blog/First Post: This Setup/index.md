So after a while hosting Gatsby and Ghost in an AWS instance, I was looking to 
build the config in Amplify so I could automate the build when I post something after realizing
I didn't post too often because of the build process.

I've been a big supporter of Gatsby, I like the approach they take for content generation
and optimization, for example, this MDX is really nice and simple.

### What did I do wrong?

Well, I basically forgot to export the six posts that I had on AWS, which is always the opportunity to re-write them!

### Was it hard?

Not at all. I'm using a simple theme they offer, which is more than enough for me right now. I'll be updating some styles, but is not my main focus at this point. Everything else were around 5 total steps you have to make, including redirecting my custom domain to Gatsby Cloud.

### Would I recommend doing it?

I mean, if you're starting to blog, plan to do it regularly, want to have full control of your layout and have hosting and builds for free, absolutely.

#### This is my first post and I'm going to keep this posts short enough.
