I have been working in startups for the last seven years, all of them have been on 
different levels of development, but mostly, I've been part of the funding team.

This allowed me to always be close to product definitions, see how the decision-makers
follow one lead and bet on it for being what helped us to get users/investors/etc, but it
had always been unclear to me how do they do it? what input is behind those decisions, mental model maybe?

Fast forward today, I stumbled a few months ago with Scott Galloway's blog and podcast and loved it. The vision
and the content he provides have, so far, been amazing and full of useful insights. He promotes Section4 on his
podcast, so I gave it a look and was fascinated by the content, which drove me to take Professor Alter's Product Sprint.

## Product Sprint

So it was exactly what I expected, just straight useful content. There so many great insights on every video
that I had to go back to when I was filling the workbook. It is completely actionable straightforward content.

There's this thing that I've found in several products lately, the community building. Personally, is hard for me
to just talk out there, even digitally, is related to many things like, doubt about what I might be saying or after 
I write the comment or post, then I realize there isn't that much value in my comment, so I delete it.

Well, over 80% of the sprint is interaction and discussion with your peers, really good discussions with so many
different points of view. You need to keep up with it but is worth it. By the end of the first week, I was
starting to feel that, even though this is my first formal approach to something like product development, my reasoning
is in the right direction most of the time, but be able to shape the thoughts and explanation consistently is where the hard
work is. Articulating the idea.

## The Project

So you have to make a project to practice what you've learned in the sprint, is not mandatory but is recommended. I did it
about my actual workplace as I'm curious about Fintech and trying to learn more about it as fast as I can. It was an amazing
exercise BUT I completely forgot the context of it, people outside my workplace was going to read it, even though my peers who 
reviewed it understood about it, they found lack of context and the recommendations were too vague, nothing in a timeline or 
explicitly actionable.

## Going Further

One of the biggest reflections that come to mind when I think about the sprint is that, having a clear reason for why you do
the things you do gives you the upper hand, always. And this is expected to be the simplest solid idea that is relatable without
the need to be articulated. No great explanation or big complex goal. This works on companies and in life, as Simon Sinek always reminds us,
you need to find your WHY.

I completely recommend it to anyone who wants to get to know more about product development.
