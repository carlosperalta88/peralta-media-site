As I grow older, I find myself being less opinionated and open to get a broader picture before making my mind. 
It all started with a video from [@GergelyOrosz](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz) about applying to FAANGS, and it caught my attention pretty fast. I bought the books he recommended and started to plan how to prepare. The books took longer to arrive, and suddenly, by some LinkedIn connection, I'm cold emailing a Facebook recruiter. To my surprise, he replied, and we set a meeting.

I'm thrilled about the challenge and everything that it implies. I have no formal education on CS, just what I've figured out by reading here and there, considering that I should go deep into the subject, but never doing it until now.

I have four weeks to prepare. I read two books, enrolled in two courses that recommended being done months before applying, solved or tried to solve as many problems as I could, dealing with frustration and A-HA moments every day. It was madness. The more I studied, the more I realized the importance of understanding all these basic CS concepts.

Probably, the Twitter algorithm figured the topics I was interested in and started to show me related content. One comment was pretty blunt about how useless these types of tests were as he had made millions of dollars not knowing anything about it or not being able to pass any of these tests.
Fair enough.

But to be honest, the last month of complete CS immersion was so enlightening. It made me realize how there's a place for everyone in the industry.
Some companies will need someone who can bootstrap an app and deliver in no time to validate their business model, raise more money, and keep growing. Other companies will need someone to optimize and improve whatever they have in place. Maybe change the language or the DB engine. The point is, it is OK. Perhaps not ideal, but OK. 

I can say now who I want to be as a software engineer. Even though my actual role is 99% managing teams, I see an improvement in my conversation with the team bringing these subjects and encouraging them to revisit and apply them. Talk about code quality as the application of optimization, clean architecture, and understanding the trade-offs we have to make, so it is elegant and straightforward. It is a game-changer on the mental model of the developers to keep these concepts in mind.

So, do you need to know about CS to build an app and make money? No. Does knowing all these concepts will improve the quality of your work? It is quite possible. There are no absolutes in how I see this learning process, but I can be sure that you will be better.

As far as my application, I busted it. I am not ready yet to solve problems like this under pressure, but I know how to improve, which is priceless. So even tho I failed, I feel I won a lot.
