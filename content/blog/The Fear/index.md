I've been thinking a lot about fear and what it means to me the past few weeks. I've always been a fearful person. Judgment from loved ones is the most painful thing I've ever experienced. Even on the most simple things like, do you like this shirt? And adding more to the equation, I'm an aspiring musician with a plan to release my music to the world. Writing this and thinking about posting it scares the hell out of me. But why?

I've been wondering myself about this because I have a child, and I don't want him to live in fear as I have. There are always great things to conquer on the other side of fear, they say. Still, I would like to understand and welcome the anxiety I get just from thinking to be exposed.

My biggest fear nowadays is to lose him. To something tragic happens and not to be able to hold his hand ever again. Is quite crazy this thought, but I've heard it is pretty standard once you become a parent. This gives me the perspective to be present with him, even if it is just for the most simple task he's trying to accomplish.

I guess that for more cliche as it sounds, we need to face our fears and stop being slaves from the scenarios we build in our heads, as we suffer more from the idea of being hurt than from being hurt. Seneca talked about it, and I find it entirely accurate. Still, it is not an easy thing to do.

And that's why I'm writing and posting about it.
