I was part of two cohorts on Section4, as I mentioned in a previous post. The last cohort was about Branding. The final class with Prof G was about applying the branding concepts to our personal brand.

One of the key takeaways is that we need to own media. Referring to how we communicate or maintain a relationship as a brand with the world and create value. That's where I concluded I'm pretty much on square -100. I haven't developed a consistent voice. I'm digitally shy so, it is hard for me -at this age- to just interact with strangers on the internet. This has held me even from publishing music or telling people I've been working on music for the last couple of years.

So to work on my voice, I'm gonna start posting content, no more than 200 words per post, about subjects I care about and things I've learned working in tech for the last 8 years. Don't expect anything too technical. There's so much better content about the subject on the internet that it would be just noise.

Leadership, creativity, fatherhood, and humanity are my most significant but not the only interests at the moment.

And as I write this, I listened to some old SoundCloud published songs from three years ago and realized that I think they sound good and absolutely gonna publish more.

More than 200 words so far.
