A few years ago, I wrote about the years that were ending. It was 2016, and the future was exciting (still is). I think I did it for a couple of years and then stopped. This post is not about how good or wrong 2021 was, nor a bullet list of things I want to do in 2022 -or maybe it is- but a view on my self-expectations.

## Personal
I need to let go. Please don't get me wrong. I'm happy and have a fantastic family. But there are times where I fail to communicate my expectations, and it gives me some anxiety when things are different from what I imagined. I've been able to talk about it afterward and reinforce that I need to share what I'm expecting beforehand because it is unfair otherwise, but it is a work in progress and something I want to get better at this year.

## Music
It fuels me. It is my passion, not as significant as being a father or a husband, but it keeps me in such a great place. Creating something new every day with my hands and achieving great-sounding products has been my dream since I'm 15 years old. I'm getting there, but I need to make the last push. I committed on October 2021 and started a music production program, and I haven't given it the attention it deserves. So that's why I'm giving myself until April to finish it and have at least three new songs published. And 12 songs by the end of the year.

## Career
One of the things that I've learned about myself in the last few years is my motivations. I enjoy helping people become the best version of themselves at work. Share my experiences, give them the freedom to try things, and discuss other ways they think they could have solved the problem. 

But I also want to explore more technical challenges and product development roles. So I will learn Swift and Rust, see what can come out of there, and develop some visual experience with three.js and my music.

That's it. I want to keep it simple and specific.

Cheers.
